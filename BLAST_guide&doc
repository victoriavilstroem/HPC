# BLAST analysis

Ready to compare some sequences to the ones in the great NCBI databese? Let's GO!
Open the BLAST.py either on cluster or your own computer.

### Sequences

The code in BLAST.py takes the sequences mentioned in this part of the script:
```
# Example DNA sequences to search
    sequences_to_search = [
        "ATTCTTCCCAGGACCTCAGCGCAGCCCTGGCCCAGGAAGGCAGGAGACAGAGGCCAGGACGGTCCAGAGGTGTCGAAATGTCCTGGGGACCTGAGCAGCAGCCACCAGGGAAGAGGCAGGGAGGGAGCTGAGGACCAGGCTTGGTTGTGAGAATCCCTGAGCCCAGGCGGTAGATGCCAGGAGGTGTCTGGACTGGCTGGGCCATGCCTGGGCTGACCTGTCCAGCCAGGGAGAGGGTGTGAGGGCAGATCTGGGGGTGCCCAGATGGAAGGAGGCAGGCATGGGGGACACCCAAGGCCCCCTGGCAGCACCATGAACTAAGCAGGACACCTGGAGGGGA",

```
Here are 3 sequences that will be compared to the NCBI database. It is a huge database, so grab a cup of tea an be patient. 
After some time in the terminal you will see the message:
```
Starting BLAST search...
Starting BLAST search...
Starting BLAST search...
```
If you were to add more sequences, you would see as many 'Starting BLAST search...' messages as there are sequences inputed.

### Processors

In this part of code you can choose the amount of processors (the HPC part) employed for the analysis:
```
num_processors=4
```
## Logic

So if I analyse 3 sequences using 4 processors I get this message:
```
Parallel processing completed in 62.37 seconds.
```
But if I analyse 6 sequences using 4 processors I get this message:
```
Parallel processing completed in 122.21 seconds.
```
So it takes twice as long, which make sense because we have more sequences than processors, hence Parallel processing is not in it's best use...

Now try 8 processors (thats the max i have on my computer, if you don't - use the cluster, it has up to 64 cores).
For 3 sequences I get similar:
```
Parallel processing completed in 62.37 seconds.
```
But for 6, now I get also:
```
Starting BLAST search...
Starting BLAST search...
Starting BLAST search...
Starting BLAST search...
Starting BLAST search...
Starting BLAST search...
Parallel processing completed in 62.46 seconds.
```

So now we have enough processors for each sequence, so the time to execute the task with 6 sequences drops copared to 4 processors
