## Prerequisites
Before we get started, make sure you have:
- **Python 3.x**: The coolest programming language around!
    Anaconda is the easiest way of installing Python on Windows, macOS (Mac), and Linux.
    To install Anaconda, head to this [site](https://www.anaconda.com/download/success).
    Click "Download". When the download has completed, double-click the file you just downloaded
    and follow the instructions on the screen.
- **VSCode**: You will also need a text editor.
    A text editor is where you write your Python code. We use VScode. You can download it
    from this [page](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
- **`numpy`**: A super handy library for number crunching.
    Once you are able to open a Python workplace on VScode and can see the Terminal window under your code,
    you can use the terminal to create an evironment (change the 'mymyenvironment' to a distinctive name,
    like 'HPCproject') that has the needed library(-ies) in it.
    (you don't need to understand how all of it works)
```
conda create -n myenvironment python numpy
```
