# Welcome to the Bioinformatics HPC Simulation Repository!

Hi! 
Are you a bioinformatintian that has never used HPC before? You are in the right place. 
During the time of writing this repository we were in the exact same spot :)

This repository is designed as a hands-on resource for bioinformatics students to explore the exciting world of HPC and its applications in biological data analysis. Through engaging mini simulations in Python, you will have the opportunity to understand the power of multiple processors in optimizing tasks such as sequence filtering.

## What Youâ€™ll Find Here
* Interactive Simulations: Experience the impact of parallel processing on bioinformatics tasks.
* Educational Resources: Access guides and documentation to enhance your understanding of HPC concepts.
* Collaborative Learning: Join a community of learners and share your insights, improvements, and questions.

## What will happen
1. You will connect to a Supercomputer from DeiC.
2. See, run and alter the code that allows you to do some bioinformatic tasks like DNA sequence or Protein structure analysis.
3. Experience how HPC allows us to work with huge amounts of data very fast, what would take a lot of time when using just your own laptop. 


We encourage you to contribute, provide feedback, and collaborate with others to make this a valuable learning experience for everyone involved.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
